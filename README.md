This is a personal project I wrote while trying to learn Java in CSE 017, Programming and Data structures. It includes many concepts taught in a standard data structures class. The basic concept of the game is there are multiple classes, Archer, FireArcher, Warrior, and Wizard and you can play on a board which is a 2 dimensional array. Player can take turn to make moves. Each class type has their own properties, skills, life points, etc. May chose to continue working on this project in the future.
